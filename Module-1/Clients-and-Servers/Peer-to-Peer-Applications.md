## Conclusion

Peer-to-Peer (P2P) applications revolutionize how devices communicate by allowing them to act as both clients and servers simultaneously. This decentralized model facilitates efficient resource sharing and collaboration among peers without relying on centralized servers for all operations. Whether fully decentralized or using a hybrid approach, P2P applications enhance scalability, reliability, and user autonomy in accessing and sharing resources across networks.

## Questions and Answers in Detail

1. **What does a P2P application allow devices to do?**
   - P2P applications enable devices to act as both clients and servers in the same communication session.

   - Each device acts as both a client, requesting resources, and a server, providing resources to other devices.

4. **Why are P2P applications considered decentralized?**
   - They distribute data storage and processing among participating devices, reducing dependency on single points of failure.

5. **What is a hybrid P2P system?**
   - A hybrid P2P system combines decentralized resource sharing with a centralized directory for locating resources.

6. **How does a hybrid P2P system handle resource location?**
   - It uses centralized index servers to store and distribute information about where resources are located among peers.
