## Conclusion

Local area networks (LANs) consist of various components including hosts, peripherals, network devices, and network media. Hosts, such as personal computers and network printers, communicate directly on the network. Shared peripherals, like cameras and scanners, rely on hosts for network communication. Network devices, such as hubs, switches, and routers, connect hosts and manage network traffic. Network media, which can be wired (copper and fiber optic) or wireless, provide the physical pathways for data transmission. Understanding the roles and interactions of these components is crucial for designing and maintaining efficient and effective LANs.

16. **What is Ethernet?**
    - Ethernet is a technology used in local area networks (LANs) for network communication.

17. **When was Ethernet commercially introduced and by whom?**
    - Ethernet was introduced in 1980 by Digital Equipment Corporation (DEC), Intel, and Xerox.

18. **When was Ethernet standardized and what is the standard called?**
    - Ethernet was standardized in 1983 as IEEE 802.3.

19. **How do devices access an Ethernet LAN?**
    - Devices access an Ethernet LAN using an Ethernet Network Interface Card (NIC).

20. **What is a Media Access Control (MAC) address?**
    - A MAC address is a unique address permanently embedded on an Ethernet NIC.

21. **What is the function of an Ethernet NIC?**
    - It allows devices to connect to and communicate over an Ethernet network.

22. **How does a local printer differ from a network printer?**
    - A local printer is directly connected to a host, while a network printer is connected to a network device and communicates directly on the network.

23. **What is the importance of network devices in a LAN?**
    - Network devices manage and control the flow of data between hosts, ensuring efficient network communication.

24. **What are the benefits of using fiber optic cables in a network?**
    - Fiber optic cables offer higher bandwidth and longer transmission distances compared to copper cables.

25. **What role does a switch play in a network?**
    - A switch connects multiple devices within a LAN and uses MAC addresses to forward data to the correct destination.

26. **How do routers differ from switches?**
    - Routers connect different networks and route data between them, while switches connect devices within the same network.

27. **What is the purpose of hubs in a network?**
    - Hubs broadcast data to all connected devices within a LAN, though they are less efficient than switches.

28. **How does wireless media transmit data in a network?**
    - Wireless media use radio frequency waves to transmit data between devices without physical cables.

29. **What are the challenges of using wireless media in a network?**
