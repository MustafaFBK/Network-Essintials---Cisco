## Conclusion

IP address configuration is a fundamental aspect of network setup, ensuring that devices can communicate effectively within a network. IP addresses can be assigned manually, known as static addressing, or automatically through dynamic configuration using DHCP servers. Both methods have their unique applications and benefits, facilitating seamless network management and connectivity.
